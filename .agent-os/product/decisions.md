## 2025-07-22: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Establish my-dotfiles as a comprehensive, modern, cross-platform development environment configuration focused on migrating from legacy VimScript to Lua-based Neovim while maintaining cross-platform compatibility for software developers and DevOps engineers.

### Context

The current dotfiles repository has grown organically over time, accumulating legacy configurations and VimScript-heavy Neovim setup. Modern Neovim capabilities with Lua configuration offer significant performance and maintainability improvements. Additionally, cross-platform development has become more common, requiring consistent tooling across macOS and Linux environments.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Keep Current VimScript Approach**
   - Pros: No migration effort, existing configuration works
   - Cons: Missing modern features, slower performance, harder to maintain

2. **Complete Rewrite from Scratch**
   - Pros: Clean slate, modern architecture
   - Cons: Loss of existing working configurations, high risk, extended development time

3. **Platform-Specific Repositories**
   - Pros: Optimized for each platform
   - Cons: Maintenance overhead, fragmented user experience, duplicate effort

### Rationale

The phased migration approach allows leveraging existing working configurations while modernizing core components. The Lua migration aligns with Neovim's direction and community best practices. Cross-platform support addresses real user needs without significant architectural complexity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Modern, performant Neovim configuration with Lua
- Consistent development experience across macOS and Linux
- Maintainable, modular configuration structure
- Community alignment with modern practices

**Negative:**
- Migration complexity requires careful planning
- Temporary disruption during transition phases
- Increased testing requirements for cross-platform compatibility

## 2025-07-22: Technology Stack Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Maintain symlink-based configuration management with Makefile installation, migrate from vim-plug to lazy.nvim for plugin management, and use mise for language runtime management across all supported languages.

### Context

The current symlink approach has proven reliable for configuration management. Plugin management with vim-plug is functional but lacks modern features like lazy loading and declarative configuration. Language runtime management with individual tools (nvm, rbenv, pyenv) creates complexity and inconsistency.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Copy-Based Configuration Management**
   - Pros: No symlink dependencies, simpler for some users
   - Cons: Update complexity, synchronization issues, backup complications

2. **Stow for Symlink Management**
   - Pros: More sophisticated symlink management
   - Cons: Additional dependency, overkill for current needs

3. **Keep vim-plug Plugin Management**
   - Pros: No migration required, familiar to users
   - Cons: Lacks lazy loading, slower startup, less declarative

### Rationale

Symlinks provide the best balance of simplicity and functionality for dotfiles management. Lazy.nvim offers significant performance improvements and better plugin management. Mise consolidates language runtime management into a single, consistent tool.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster Neovim startup with lazy loading
- Unified language runtime management
- Better plugin dependency resolution
- Modern configuration patterns

**Negative:**
- Plugin migration complexity
- Learning curve for mise vs individual managers
- Potential compatibility issues during transition

## 2025-07-22: Cross-Platform Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement intelligent OS detection with adaptive configurations rather than separate platform-specific repositories, prioritizing macOS as primary platform with Linux as fully supported secondary platform.

### Context

Users increasingly work across multiple operating systems and need consistent development environments. Maintaining separate repositories creates fragmentation and maintenance overhead. However, platform differences require some adaptation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **macOS-Only Focus**
   - Pros: Simpler development, fewer edge cases
   - Cons: Excludes Linux users, limits market reach

2. **Separate Repositories per Platform**
   - Pros: Platform optimization, cleaner separation
   - Cons: Maintenance overhead, user confusion, duplicate effort

3. **Docker-Based Development Environment**
   - Pros: True platform independence
   - Cons: Performance overhead, complexity, not suitable for all use cases

### Rationale

Intelligent OS detection allows maximizing shared configuration while adapting to platform differences. This approach serves both user bases without significant maintenance complexity. Prioritizing macOS acknowledges current user base while ensuring Linux support for growing demand.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Single repository simplifies maintenance
- Users get consistent experience across platforms
- Gradual migration path for users switching platforms
- Community contributions benefit all platforms

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in configuration logic
- More extensive testing requirements
- Platform-specific edge cases need handling
- Initial development effort higher
