> Spec: Plugin Manager Migration

> Status: Planning

## Overview

Migrate from vim-plug to lazy.nvim for improved performance, lazy loading capabilities, and modern declarative plugin management while preserving all existing plugin functionality and maintaining backward compatibility during the transition.

## User Stories

### Modern Plugin Management Experience

As a developer, I want to have fast Neovim startup times with lazy-loaded plugins, so that I can quickly start editing without waiting for all plugins to initialize upfront.

The current vim-plug setup loads all plugins on startup, causing slower initialization times. The migration to lazy.nvim will implement intelligent lazy loading, where plugins are only loaded when needed (on specific file types, commands, or key mappings). This will significantly reduce startup time while maintaining full functionality.

### Seamless Migration Process

As a user of the existing configuration, I want the migration to preserve all my current plugin functionality and configurations, so that my workflow remains uninterrupted after the update.

The migration process will maintain compatibility with all existing plugin configurations in the plug-config/ directory. All current plugins will continue to work exactly as before, but with improved performance and modern management capabilities.

### LazyVim-Style Configuration

As a Neovim user, I want access to modern plugin configuration patterns used by LazyVim, so that I can benefit from community best practices and easier plugin management.

The new configuration will adopt LazyVim-style plugin specifications with declarative configuration, dependency management, and event-based loading triggers.

## Spec Scope

1. **Plugin Manager Replacement** - Replace vim-plug with lazy.nvim as the primary plugin manager
2. **Plugin Migration** - Convert all 40+ existing plugins to lazy.nvim specifications
3. **Lazy Loading Implementation** - Configure appropriate loading triggers for each plugin type
4. **Configuration Preservation** - Maintain all existing plugin configurations in plug-config/
5. **Performance Optimization** - Implement lazy loading patterns for improved startup time

## Out of Scope

- Changes to individual plugin configurations or functionality
- Addition of new plugins beyond the existing set
- Modification of key mappings or user interface
- Changes to theme or colorscheme behavior

## Expected Deliverable

1. All existing plugins successfully migrated to lazy.nvim with preserved functionality
2. Neovim startup time improved by at least 30% through lazy loading
3. All plugin-specific configurations continue to work without modification
4. Fallback mechanism ensures compatibility if lazy.nvim installation fails
