# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-plugin-manager-migration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Replace vim-plug initialization and plugin definitions with lazy.nvim setup
- Maintain all existing plugin functionality without breaking changes
- Implement lazy loading patterns appropriate for each plugin category
- Preserve existing plug-config/ directory structure and configurations
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (macOS and Linux)
- Provide performance metrics to validate startup time improvements
- Create fallback mechanism for vim-plug if lazy.nvim fails to install

## Approach Options

**Option A: Complete Replacement**
- Pros: Clean migration, full lazy.nvim benefits, modern configuration
- Cons: Higher risk, potential for breaking changes, all-or-nothing approach

**Option B: Gradual Migration with Dual Support** (Selected)
- Pros: Lower risk, can test plugins individually, fallback available
- Cons: Temporary complexity, dual maintenance during transition

**Option C: Fork and Separate Branch**
- Pros: No risk to main configuration, easy rollback
- Cons: Maintenance overhead, delayed benefits, potential drift

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of safety and progress. We can migrate plugins in logical groups while maintaining the ability to fall back to vim-plug if issues arise. This approach aligns with our backward compatibility requirements and risk management strategy.

## External Dependencies

- **lazy.nvim** - Modern plugin manager for Neovim
  - **Justification:** Industry standard for modern Neovim configurations, superior performance through lazy loading, active development and community support
- **plenary.nvim** - Already included, required by lazy.nvim for utility functions

## Plugin Migration Categories

### Core System Plugins
- Better Syntax Support (vim-polyglot)
- Auto pairs (auto-pairs)
- File management (nvim-tree.lua, winshift.nvim)

### Themes and UI
- 12 theme plugins (onedark, nightfox, catppuccin, etc.)
- Status line (vim-airline)
- Icons (nvim-web-devicons)
- Visual enhancements (nvim-colorizer, indent-blankline)

### LSP and Code Intelligence
- Mason ecosystem (mason.nvim, mason-lspconfig.nvim)
- Native LSP (nvim-lspconfig)
- Formatting and linting (conform.nvim, nvim-lint)
- Completion and AI (copilot.vim, CopilotChat.nvim)

### Navigation and Search
- Fuzzy finding (fzf, fzf.vim)
- File navigation (quick-scope, vim-sneak)
- Text objects (targets.vim, vim-textobj-ruby)

### Git Integration
- Core git tools (vim-fugitive, vim-signify)
- Git UI (lazygit.nvim, gv.vim)

### Editing Enhancement
- Text manipulation (vim-surround, vim-commentary)
- Utility plugins (vim-repeat, vim-bufkill, floaterm)

## Lazy Loading Strategy

### Event-Based Loading
- LSP plugins: on `LspAttach` event
- Git plugins: on git file detection
- File type plugins: on specific `FileType` events

### Command-Based Loading
- Terminal plugins: on command invocation
- Git UI tools: on specific commands
- Utility plugins: on first use

### Key-Based Loading
- Navigation plugins: on specific key mappings
- Text objects: on operator-pending mode

## Performance Targets

- Startup time reduction: minimum 30%
- Plugin loading time: under 50ms per plugin when triggered
- Memory usage: no increase from current baseline
- All functionality preserved with no regression in features
