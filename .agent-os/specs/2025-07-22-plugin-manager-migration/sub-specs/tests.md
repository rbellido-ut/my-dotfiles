## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Plugin Installation Tests**
- Verify lazy.nvim installs successfully on first run
- Test automatic plugin installation for all migrated plugins
- Validate plugin loading triggers work correctly
- Confirm fallback to vim-plug if lazy.nvim fails

**Configuration Loading Tests**
- Test all plugin configurations load without errors
- Verify plug-config/ directory files are sourced correctly
- Check theme switching functionality works with lazy-loaded themes
- Validate LSP configurations initialize properly

### Integration Tests

**Startup Performance Tests**
- Measure Neovim startup time before and after migration
- Verify startup time improves by at least 30%
- Test that frequently used plugins load within 50ms
- Confirm memory usage doesn't increase

**Plugin Functionality Tests**
- Test all major plugin features work identically to vim-plug version
- Verify git integration plugins (fugitive, signify, lazygit) function correctly
- Check file navigation and search plugins (fzf, nvim-tree) work properly
- Test LSP functionality (mason, lspconfig, formatting, linting) operates normally
- Validate theme switching and UI plugins render correctly

**Cross-Platform Compatibility Tests**
- Test migration works on both macOS and Linux
- Verify plugin installations succeed on different operating systems
- Check that lazy loading triggers work consistently across platforms

### Feature Tests

**Lazy Loading Behavior**
- Verify plugins only load when triggered by appropriate events
- Test that unused plugins remain unloaded during session
- Check that plugin loading doesn't cause noticeable delays
- Validate dependency resolution works correctly

**Backward Compatibility Tests**
- Confirm all existing key mappings continue to work
- Test that user customizations in plug-config/ are preserved
- Verify theme preferences and settings are maintained
- Check that git workflow and commands remain unchanged

**Error Recovery Tests**
- Test behavior when individual plugins fail to load
- Verify graceful degradation when lazy.nvim is unavailable
- Check fallback to vim-plug works seamlessly
- Test error messages are informative and actionable

## Mocking Requirements

- **Network Requests:** Mock GitHub API calls for plugin installation
- **File System:** Mock plugin directory creation and file operations
- **Neovim Events:** Mock LSP attach events, file type detection, and other triggers
- **External Commands:** Mock git commands and external tool invocations
