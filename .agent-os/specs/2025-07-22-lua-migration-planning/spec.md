# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Lua Migration Planning
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Perform comprehensive audit and planning for migrating Neovim configuration from VimScript to modern Lua-based architecture with lazy.nvim plugin management. This foundation work will identify all components requiring migration and establish a strategic approach for modernizing the configuration while maintaining functionality and user experience.

## User Stories

### Configuration Modernization Audit

As a developer maintaining the my-dotfiles configuration, I want to thoroughly audit the current VimScript-based Neovim setup, so that I can identify all components that need migration to Lua and understand the scope of the modernization effort.

The workflow involves analyzing 28 VimScript files across init.vim, settings, mappings, plugin configurations, and themes to categorize each component by complexity, dependencies, and migration approach. This includes evaluating the current vim-plug plugin ecosystem with 100+ plugins to determine Lua equivalents and lazy.nvim compatibility.

### LazyVim Architecture Planning

As a developer preparing for modern Neovim configuration, I want to design a comprehensive Lua directory structure following LazyVim patterns, so that I can ensure the migrated configuration is maintainable, performant, and follows community best practices.

This involves planning the target directory structure, identifying which components should be converted to Lua modules, and establishing the migration approach for each category of configuration (core settings, keymaps, plugins, themes, LSP configurations).

### Migration Strategy Development

As a developer executing the modernization project, I want a prioritized migration plan with clear dependencies and testing approaches, so that I can systematically convert the configuration while minimizing downtime and ensuring no functionality is lost.

The strategy will define migration phases, identify plugin compatibility requirements, establish testing procedures for each component, and create rollback procedures for safe migration execution.

## Spec Scope

1. **VimScript Configuration Audit** - Complete analysis of all 28 VimScript files including init.vim, settings.vim, mappings.vim, plugin configs, and theme files
2. **Plugin Ecosystem Analysis** - Evaluation of 100+ vim-plug managed plugins for Lua equivalents and lazy.nvim migration path
3. **Target Architecture Design** - LazyVim-style Lua directory structure and module organization planning
4. **Migration Priority Matrix** - Component categorization by complexity, dependencies, and migration approach
5. **Dependency Mapping** - Identification of plugin interdependencies and configuration relationships that affect migration order

## Out of Scope

- Actual code migration or implementation work
- Plugin testing or compatibility validation
- Performance benchmarking of current vs target configuration
- User documentation updates

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete audit report of current VimScript configuration with categorized component analysis
2. Comprehensive plugin migration matrix with Lua alternatives and compatibility assessment  
3. Detailed LazyVim-style target architecture with directory structure and module organization plan
