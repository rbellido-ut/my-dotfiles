# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-lua-migration-planning/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Comprehensive File Analysis**: Deep analysis of 28 core VimScript files using file system tools and content parsing
- **Plugin Ecosystem Mapping**: Evaluation of 100+ plugins from vim-plug/plugins.vim with research into Lua alternatives
- **Architecture Documentation**: Creation of detailed directory structure diagrams and module dependency maps
- **Migration Categorization**: Classification system for complexity levels (Simple, Moderate, Complex) and migration approaches
- **Compatibility Assessment**: Research methodology for evaluating plugin Lua support and lazy.nvim compatibility

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Manual File-by-File Analysis
- Pros: Thorough understanding of each component, detailed categorization possible
- Cons: Time-intensive, risk of missing interdependencies

**Option B:** Automated Analysis with Manual Review (Selected)
- Pros: Comprehensive coverage with efficiency, systematic approach to categorization
- Cons: May require custom tooling for specific analysis needs

**Option C:** High-Level Strategic Planning Only  
- Pros: Quick overview and general direction
- Cons: Insufficient detail for reliable migration execution

**Rationale:** Option B provides the optimal balance of thoroughness and efficiency. Automated analysis ensures complete coverage of all files and plugins, while manual review allows for nuanced categorization and strategic decision-making that automation cannot provide.

## External Dependencies

- **LazyVim Documentation** - Reference implementation patterns and best practices
  - Justification: Provides proven architecture patterns for modern Neovim Lua configuration
- **Neovim Lua Guide** - Official documentation for Lua API and migration patterns  
  - Justification: Essential reference for understanding Lua equivalents of VimScript functionality
- **Plugin Research Tools** - Access to GitHub, documentation sites for plugin compatibility research
  - Justification: Required for comprehensive plugin ecosystem analysis and alternative identification

## Analysis Framework

### VimScript Component Categories

1. **Core Configuration** (init.vim, settings.vim)
   - Initialization order and sourcing logic
   - Global settings and options
   - Bootstrap and setup procedures

2. **Key Mappings** (keys/mappings.vim)
   - Leader key definitions
   - Mode-specific key bindings  
   - Plugin-specific mappings

3. **Plugin Configurations** (plug-config/*.vim)
   - Individual plugin setup files
   - Plugin-specific settings and customizations
   - Integration configurations

4. **Theme System** (themes/*.vim)
   - Color scheme configurations
   - Theme switching logic
   - Appearance customizations

### Plugin Migration Matrix Criteria

- **Lua Native**: Plugin already supports or requires Lua configuration
- **Lua Compatible**: Plugin works with Lua but has VimScript config  
- **Lua Alternative**: Different plugin needed that supports Lua
- **Legacy Only**: Plugin has no Lua alternative, requires VimScript bridge

### Target Architecture Components

- **init.lua**: Entry point and core initialization
- **lua/config/**: Core Neovim settings and options
- **lua/plugins/**: Plugin specifications for lazy.nvim
- **lua/keymaps/**: Key mapping definitions
- **lua/utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
