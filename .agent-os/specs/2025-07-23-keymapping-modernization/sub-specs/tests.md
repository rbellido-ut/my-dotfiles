## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Keymap Module Loading**
- Test that all keymap modules load without errors
- Verify conditional plugin keymap loading works correctly
- Test that core keymaps are always available
- Validate keymap module structure and exports

**Individual Keymap Functions**
- Test that each migrated keymap triggers correct command
- Verify keymap options (noremap, silent) are properly set
- Test mode-specific mappings work in correct modes only
- Validate special function-based keymaps execute properly

**Which-Key Registration**
- Test that all keymaps are registered with which-key
- Verify descriptions are present and meaningful
- Test group organization and naming consistency
- Ensure no duplicate or conflicting registrations

### Integration Tests

**VimScript to Lua Migration**
- Compare behavior of old VimScript mappings vs new Lua equivalents
- Test that all original keybindings still function identically
- Verify no regressions in keymap behavior or functionality
- Test special cases like expression mappings and buffer-local mappings

**Plugin Integration**
- Test plugin-specific keymaps work when plugins are loaded
- Verify graceful handling when plugins are not available
- Test plugin keymap overrides and conflicts resolution
- Validate lazy loading doesn't break keymap functionality

**Which-Key User Experience**
- Test leader key displays organized menu with all options
- Verify submenus and grouping work correctly
- Test keymap discovery through which-key interface
- Validate consistent naming and description patterns

### Feature Tests

**Core Editor Workflow**
- Test complete window management workflow (navigation, resizing)
- Verify buffer navigation and management keymaps
- Test text editing shortcuts and insert mode mappings
- Execute complete file search and navigation workflows

**Plugin Workflow Integration**
- Test Git workflow with lazygit, fugitive, and signify keymaps
- Verify AI/Copilot integration keymaps work end-to-end
- Test file explorer (NvimTree) keymap integration
- Execute search workflows with FZF/RipGrep keymaps

**Customization and Override**
- Test user keymap customization mechanisms
- Verify override system doesn't break core functionality
- Test that custom keymaps integrate with which-key
- Validate configuration reload and update scenarios

### Mocking Requirements

**Plugin Availability**
- Mock plugin loading states for conditional keymap testing
- Simulate plugin unavailability to test graceful degradation
- Mock plugin-specific functions to test keymap registration

**Vim Functions**
- Mock vim.keymap.set() calls to verify correct parameters
- Simulate different Neovim modes for mode-specific testing  
- Mock which-key registration functions for integration testing

**User Input Simulation**
- Mock key sequences to test keymap execution
- Simulate leader key sequences for which-key menu testing
- Mock complex key combinations and timing scenarios

## Performance Tests

**Startup Impact**
- Benchmark keymap loading time vs previous implementation
- Measure which-key registration overhead
- Test impact on Neovim startup time

**Runtime Performance**
- Measure keymap lookup and execution time
- Test which-key menu display performance
- Benchmark large keymap set handling

## Regression Testing

**Existing Functionality**
- Comprehensive test of all current keybindings
- Verification that no functionality is lost in migration
- Test for any new conflicts or unexpected behaviors

**User Workflow Validation**
- Test common development workflows remain unchanged
- Verify muscle memory patterns still work
- Validate that frequently used keybindings behave identically

## Test Data and Scenarios

**Keymap Categories to Test:**
- Window and split management
- Buffer navigation and management  
- File operations and search
- Text editing and manipulation
- Git operations and version control
- Plugin-specific functionality
- Insert mode and completion shortcuts

**Edge Cases:**
- Conflicting keymap definitions
- Plugin loading race conditions
- Invalid keymap configurations
- Missing plugin dependencies
- User override conflicts
