# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Keymapping Modernization
> Created: 2025-07-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Modernize and consolidate the key mapping system by migrating from scattered VimScript mappings to a unified, organized Lua-based system with comprehensive which-key integration. This will improve keymap discoverability, eliminate duplication between VimScript and Lua mappings, and provide a more maintainable and user-friendly key binding experience.

## User Stories

### Unified Keymap Experience

As a Neovim user, I want all my key mappings to be discoverable through which-key with proper descriptions and logical grouping, so that I can easily find and remember keyboard shortcuts without consulting documentation or configuration files.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- User presses `<leader>` and sees organized menu of available commands
- Each keymap has a clear, descriptive label explaining its function
- Related commands are grouped together (e.g., git operations, buffer management, AI tools)
- System provides visual feedback and guidance for multi-key sequences

### Maintainable Configuration

As a configuration maintainer, I want all key mappings defined in a single, well-organized Lua module with clear categorization, so that adding, modifying, or removing keybindings is straightforward and doesn't require hunting through multiple files.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- All keymaps are defined in centralized Lua configuration
- Clear separation between core editor mappings and plugin-specific mappings
- Consistent naming conventions and organizational structure
- Easy override mechanism for user customizations

### Performance and Consistency

As a developer, I want fast keymap registration and consistent behavior across different modes, so that my editing workflow remains smooth and predictable without the mixed VimScript/Lua inconsistencies.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- All mappings use modern vim.keymap.set() API for consistency
- Lazy loading of plugin-specific keymaps to improve startup time
- Consistent modifier key usage and logical key combinations
- No conflicting or duplicate mappings between old and new systems

## Spec Scope

1. **Lua Migration** - Convert all VimScript key mappings from keys/mappings.vim to modern Lua syntax
2. **Which-Key Integration** - Register all meaningful keymaps with which-key including descriptions and grouping
3. **Centralized Organization** - Consolidate scattered keymap definitions into logical, maintainable modules
4. **Plugin-Specific Keymaps** - Organize plugin keymaps within their respective configurations with which-key registration
5. **Legacy Cleanup** - Remove duplicate VimScript mappings and ensure no conflicts exist

## Out of Scope

- Changing existing key combinations that users are accustomed to
- Adding new functionality or commands beyond organizing existing ones
- Modifying plugin behaviors or adding new plugins
- Creating custom key mapping frameworks or abstractions

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete Lua Migration** - All key mappings use vim.keymap.set() with proper options and no VimScript remnants
2. **Which-Key Discovery** - Press `<leader>` and see organized, labeled menu of all available commands with logical grouping
3. **Clean Configuration Structure** - Single source of truth for keymaps with clear organization and maintainable code structure
