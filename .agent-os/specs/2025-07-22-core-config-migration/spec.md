# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Core Configuration Migration
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Convert the current Neovim configuration from VimScript-based (init.vim) to modern Lua setup while preserving all existing functionality. This migration establishes the foundation for future plugin management system migration and follows LazyVim patterns for structure and organization.

## User Stories

### Configuration Modernization

As a Neovim user, I want to migrate my configuration to Lua, so that I can benefit from modern Neovim features, better performance, and improved maintainability while keeping all current functionality intact.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User continues to use Neovim with current functionality preserved
2. All settings, key mappings, and behaviors remain identical
3. Configuration structure becomes modular and follows modern Lua patterns
4. Foundation is prepared for future lazy.nvim migration
5. vim-plug remains temporarily for plugin stability

### Developer Experience Enhancement

As a developer maintaining this configuration, I want a modular Lua structure, so that individual components can be easily modified, extended, or debugged without affecting the entire configuration.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Each configuration area (options, keymaps, etc.) becomes a separate Lua module
2. Clear separation between core configuration and plugin-specific settings
3. Consistent module loading and error handling
4. Documentation and comments explain the structure

## Spec Scope

1. **init.vim to init.lua Conversion** - Replace VimScript entry point with Lua equivalent that loads all modules
2. **Settings Migration** - Convert general/settings.vim to lua/config/options.lua with identical functionality
3. **Keymaps Migration** - Convert keys/mappings.vim to lua/config/keymaps.lua preserving all current bindings
4. **Module Structure Setup** - Create proper Lua module organization following LazyVim patterns
5. **Compatibility Layer** - Ensure existing vim-plug and VimScript plugin configs continue working

## Out of Scope

- Plugin management system migration (vim-plug to lazy.nvim)
- Plugin configuration conversion to Lua
- Theme/colorscheme migration
- LSP configuration changes
- Performance optimizations beyond the migration itself

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working init.lua** - Neovim starts with identical functionality to current init.vim setup
2. **Modular Configuration** - All settings and keymaps organized in separate Lua modules with clear structure
3. **Preserved Functionality** - All current key bindings, settings, and behaviors work exactly as before
